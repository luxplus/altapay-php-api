Altapay - PHP API  
=================

For accessing Altapay payment gateway through the API

### Install

`composer require luxplus/altapay-php-api`

or add it to your `composer.json` file

```json
"require": {
    "luxplus/altapay-php-api": "^1.0"
}
```

### Usage

For doing a [`capture`](docs/capture.md) the following can be used

```php
$auth = new \Altapay\Authentication('username', 'password' , 'myshop.gateway.com');
$api = new \Altapay\Api\CaptureReservation($auth);
$api->setTransactionId('transaction id');
// Or you can use a transaction object you got from a previous API call
// $api->setTransaction($transactionObject);
try {
    $response = $api->call();
    // If everything went perfect, you will get a \Altapay\Api\Document\Capture in the response
} catch (\Altapay\Api\Exceptions\ClientException $e) {
    // If anything went wrong, you will get a exception where you can see the raw request and the raw response
}
```
